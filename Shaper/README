If you are like me a newbie with HSFC queueing and have a complex
pfsense setup like multi-wan-lan-squid but you NEED shapping, you could use an all-in-one global tabular view that include cascading tree-like view, link to straight edit each queue, options of each queue and monitoring !

These modifications also include a button to view raw queue config

You need to replace two pfsense originals files (make backup before!!!) firewall-shaper.php and shaper.inc
Implementation will be improved (like include the view in diff√©rent php file and access from pfsense tab navigation inside shapping area) if 

Tested with 2.0.1 pfsense.
