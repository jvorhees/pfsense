If you are like me a newbie with HSFC queueing and have a complex
pfsense setup like multi-wan-lan-squid but you NEED shapping and want understand it a little, you could use an all-in-one global tabular view that include cascading tree-like view, link to straight edit each queue, options of each queue and monitoring !

These modifications also include a button to view raw queue config

You need to replace two pfsense originals files (make backup before!!!) firewall_shaper.php and shaper.inc
in respectively /usr/local/www and /etc/inc

Implementation will be improved (like include the stuff in different php file and access from pfsense tab navigation inside shapping area) if asked.

Hope this kind of all-in-one view will be included in futures pfsense releases ;-)

Tested with 2.0.1 pfsense.
